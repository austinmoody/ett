<h2><i class="caption glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt"></i> C-CDA Validation</h2>

<p>
The tests in this surveillance area are not linked to any ONC provided test data. Therefore, the (b)(1) Section (ii) "Validate and display" elements are not present. This is due to the fact that the C-CDA Validator on ETT performs strict validation to the gold standard reference files provided by ONC for the 2015 Edition. Outside of the certification testing intent, use the C-CDA validator found at: www.healthit.gov/scorecard. This C-CDA Scorecard uses best practices and quantitative scoring criteria developed by HL7 to improve the implementation of health care standards in C-CDA data.
</p>
<p>
DirectTrust members can also send a C-CDA for quantitative scoring to the ONC One Click Scorecard: <a href="mailto:scorecard@direct.hhs.gov" target="_blank">scorecard@direct.hhs.gov</a>
