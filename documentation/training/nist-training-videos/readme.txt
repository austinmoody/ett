These videos were created when the infrastructure was hosted by NIST.
Since it has been migrated to SITE - some of the server names referenced in these videos may not be extant and need to be
appropriately adjusted. A rough guideline is as follows -

edge.nist.gov --> ttpedge.sitenv.org
hit-testing.nist.gov ---> ttpds2.sitenv.org
hit-testing2.nist.gov --> ttpds.sitenv.org
https://edge.nist.gov/ett --> https://ttpedge.sitenv.org/ttp

Optionally,

hit-dev.nist.gov  --> ttpedgedev.sitenv.org
